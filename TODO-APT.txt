Hereâ€™s what needs to be done to create a nice repo:

Add CydiaIcon.png to the root of the repository. It is displayed at 32x32, and it would be best for the file to be at Retina resolution (64x64 for @2x and 96x96 for @3x).


Update fields in the Release file


Add depictions (which can be handled nicely through JS)
